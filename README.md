This setup helps to build raspberry pi build in an isolated environment with docker.

Prerequisites
=============

Install Docker
--------------
There are various methods of installing [docker], i.e. by docker script:

If you download the script, make sure you have `curl` installed:

if `curl` is not installed, run:
  ```{.sh}
  $ sudo apt install curl
  ```

Then download and run the docker installation script:
  ```{.sh}
  $ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
  $ sudo sh get-docker.sh
  ```

Run docker without sudo
-----------------------

To work better with docker, without `sudo`, add your user to `docker group`.
  ```{.sh}
  $ sudo usermod -aG docker <your_user>
  ```

Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.

Restart Docker

```{.sh}
  $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  $ sudo systemctl restart docker
```

Build Raspberry pi image with docker
======================
```{.sh}
.
├── Dockerfile-Ubuntu-24.04
├── README.md
├── docker-build.sh
├── docker-run.sh
├── env.sh
```

Set variables
-------------

Use `env.sh` to set variables for your build setup.
Make sure you have created a working directory,
owned by current user, on a larger partition.

Create a yocto-ready docker image
---------------------------------

Run `docker-build.sh` with one argument, related to Dockerfile,
corresponding to the operating system,
for example the Dockerfile for Ubuntu version 22.04:

```{.sh}
  $ ./docker-build.sh Ubuntu-24.04-Dockerfile
```

Run the yocto-ready docker container
-----------------------------------------------

```{.sh}
  $ ./docker-run.sh
```

When running, volumes are used to save the build artifacts on host.
  - `{DOCKER_WORKDIR}` as the main workspace
  - `{HOME}` to mount the current home user, to make available the user
    settings inside the container (ssh keys, git config, etc)
  - `{SSTATE_DIR}` build cache directory.
  - `{DL_DIR}` download directory.
